# Scrape Plate 

Custom scraping tool for static and dynamic web-sites. Perfect for open-source researchers doing repetitive information gathering tasks.

## About

This app allows researchers to define schemas for the information they want to capture on a given site, and upon navigating to a page conforming to a given schema, instantly capture the site's information points and export that data to a easily digestible format.

The objective of this application is to free up the time spent on capturing information from various open source information repositories, especially dynamically-generated repositories that are not susceptible to automatic scraping techniques.

**Use cases:** 
- Company information repositories
- Frequently visited target websites
- Populating table and report templates with project data

In addition, this app will give the researcher flexibility to group data into projects, assign scraped data tags (such as time stamps), and allow the user the visualise changes to data over time.

This application was conceived by an experienced open source intelligence researcher who found the constant trips to sites to gather 
structured company information to be repetitive, prone to error, and boring.

## Installation

The application will be available on the Chrome Web Store, however anyone who is interested contributing to the project may download the source code and current public build here.

## Usage

More to come soon.
